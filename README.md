# AssemblyLanguageQuines
Win64, Win32, DOS16, MacOS 64-bit and 32-bit Quines ~ alCoPaUL [GIMO][As][aBrA][NPA][b8][BCVG][rRlf] 2/1/2023, NYC

The .zip and .z01 files contain the build tools, runtime environments/libraries and ready to make assembly language source codes (and some epic readmes and notes).
The MacOS 64-bit and 32-bit Quines should assemble using the NASM Assembler Versions in the repository and should link with no errors using the ld version in and run successfully under fully updated MacOS X version 10.6 Snow Leopard (version 10.6.8).
