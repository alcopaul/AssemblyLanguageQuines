# AssemblyLanguageQuines
Win64, Win32, DOS16, MacOS 64-bit and 32-bit Quines ~ alCoPaUL [GIMO][As][aBrA][NPA][b8][BCVG][rRlf] 2/1/2023, NYC

The .zip and .z01 files contain the build tools, runtime environments/libraries and ready to make assembly language source codes (and some epic readmes and notes).
The MacOS 64-bit and 32-bit Quines should assemble using the NASM Assembler Versions in the repository and should link with no errors using the ld version in and run successfully under fully updated MacOS X version 10.6 Snow Leopard (version 10.6.8).

UPDATE: 2/27/2023

Added 3 Quines that Can Be Assembled in TASM32, MASM32 and MASM64.

MTAsm.zip containes the necessary libraries for you to build the quines.
delta3TASM32MASM32MASM64QUINE.txt are the 3 source codes (ended by CrLf, the defacto line break for Microsoft)

Notes For TASM32, MASM32, MASM64 Quines 
UPDATE: March 1, 2023

1.) Adjust your text viewer (e.g. Notepad) to open with Windows CRLF formatting.
2.) Adjust your Windows console up to the 169th column for the artsy/proper view of the quine..
3.) For the first quine, replace the tilde (~) with the minus (-) sign.
4.) To get the proper source code output, do the birdquine.exe > birdquine.txt and assemble/link birdquine.txt for the roundtrip, proving that it is indeed a quine.

Build Tools:
a.) Use Visual Studio 2010 x86/win64 build tools. The libs should be compatible but I included the exact libs as a separate download just in case.
b.) Obtain TASM 5 and update it with the necessary .exe patches coz assembling the TASM32 source code with the vanilla/rtm version leads to error. You can download the LATEST TASM32.EXE (version 5.4) from Embarcadero's C++ Builder 10.4 Suite, which is free to try. I used TLINK32.EXE (updated) from TASM 5 suite. You can use any of the 2 Microsoft C Runtime libs (the one with "t" and the other one with "latest") that I provided with no error.

UPDATE: March 2, 2023

Added: 16-bit TASM and MASM Quines
1.) ARIESGOAT.ASM.TXT (SOURCE CODES)
2.) MTAsm1616.zip (Ready to assemble and link files and essential files)

UPDATE: March 3, 2023
1.) Fixed the HardCoded Carriage Return from programmatically using CrLF on Windows 10 to Windows XP 64-bit which will lead to formatting issues.
2.) Files uploaded are: BENUFIREBIRDFENGHUANG.txt & MTAsm5510.zip

UPDATE: March 5, 2023
1.) Posted Win32 ad Win64 NASM quines that only uses Lf (\n). sulfur16 and the 2 first Ever MacOS Quines are reposted. File: nasmquinesspcsp4cesulfur16SnowLeopard64SnowLeopard.txt
