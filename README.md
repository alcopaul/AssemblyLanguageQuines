# AssemblyLanguageQuines
Win64, Win32, DOS16, MacOS 64-bit and 32-bit Quines ~ alCoPaUL [GIMO][As][aBrA][NPA][b8][BCVG][rRlf] 2/1/2023, NYC

The .zip and .z01 files contain the build tools, runtime environments/libraries and ready to make assembly language source codes (and some epic readmes and notes).
The MacOS 64-bit and 32-bit Quines should assemble using the NASM Assembler Versions in the repository and should link with no errors using the ld version in and run successfully under fully updated MacOS X version 10.6 Snow Leopard (version 10.6.8).

UPDATE: 2/27/2023

Added 3 Quines that Can Be Assembled in TASM32, MASM32 and MASM64.

MTAsm.zip containes the necessary libraries for you to build the quines.
delta3TASM32MASM32MASM64QUINE.txt are the 3 source codes (ended by CrLf, the defacto line break for Microsoft)
